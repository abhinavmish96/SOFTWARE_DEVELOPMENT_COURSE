## This module on Variables and Data Types. In this module, you will learn about various aspects of computational thinking. You will learn how to compile and run your program on the command line. Also, you will be introduced to the concept of variables in programming and the various data types that exist in Java.

### In this session, you will learn about the following aspects of computer programming:

**1. Introduction to computational thinking**

**2. Installation of JDK**

**3. The ‘Hello World’ Program on Command Prompt**

**4. Integrated Development Environment (IDE) - IntelliJ**

**5. Variables**

**6. Primitive Data Types**


## Computational Thinking

### Computational thinking involves expressing solutions to the problems in ways that a computer can understand.There are four major steps involved with computational thinking:

**1. Decomposition:**
This involves breaking a problem into several smaller ones. For example, consider that you want to reverse the name of a file. (i.e. Images should change to segami)
Let us now list down the things that the computer should be able to do in order to accomplish this task:

- Navigating to the desired folder.

- Should be able to reverse the characters of a word or a sentence(which will be the filename)

**2. Pattern Recognition:**
Pattern recognition is the ability to recognise patterns or similarities in the smaller chunks that you broke your problem down to. It is a boon if you are looking to save time and the resources invested in problem-solving. It is frequently the basis for solving problems and designing problem-solving strategies.
Let’s think of a very basic question. If you are told to find the 400th term of the sequence 1, 3, 6, 10….
How will you go about it? Will you go till the 400th term or are you already starting to see something in it? Do you find a pattern that is repeating itself in this sequence?

**3. Abstraction:**

Abstraction involves working on relevant information and ignoring information that is not useful to the problem at hand.

Consider the following examples:

While browsing a particular website, you just type the URL of the site and click Enter. You never think of how typing this takes you to your required website. If every time you try to open a website, you want to know how the URL opens it and how the contents appear on the page, you are not doing justice to your original problem, which is, let’s say, retrieving the contact information of the company from the website. Retrieving this information doesn’t require you to know how websites work.

Abstraction means reducing and figuring out the relevant details of a problem so that it can be modelled computationally, thus reducing the complexity of the problem. In other words, it is an approach where you don’t think about a problem in very specific terms. Rather, you focus your attention on the more general and key information about the problem.

**4. Algorithm Design:**

Representation of your plan in step-by-step sequential instructions. This is what we call algorithms or algorithm designs.

Remember, the steps should be well defined, exhaustive, sequential, and should have a finite endpoint, i.e. the one who is reading the instructions should clearly know when to stop.
